      "I remember the first gathering of Nostr devs two years ago in Costa Rica. We were all psyched because Nostr appeared to solve the problem of self-sovereign online identity and decentralized publishing. The protocol seemed well-suited for textual content, but it wasn't really designed to handle binary files, like images or video.\n\n## The Problem\n\nWhen I publish a note that contains an image link, the note itself is resilient thanks to Nostr, but if the hosting service disappears or takes my image down, my note will be broken forever. We need a way to publish binary data without relying on a single hosting provider.\n\nWe were discussing how there really was no reliable solution to this problem even outside of Nostr. Peer-to-peer attempts like IPFS simply didn't work; they were hopelessly slow and unreliable in practice. Torrents worked for popular files like movies, but couldn't be relied on for general file hosting.\n\n## Awesome Blossom\n\nA year later, I attended the Sovereign Engineering demo day in Madeira, organized by Pablo and Gigi. Many projects were presented over a three hour demo session that day, but one really stood out for me.\n\nIntroduced by hzrd149 and Stu Bowman, Blossom blew my mind because it showed how we can solve complex problems easily by simply relying on the fact that Nostr exists. Having an open user directory, with the corresponding social graph and web of trust is an incredible building block.\n\nSince we can easily look up any user on Nostr and read their profile metadata, we can just get them to simply *tell us* where their files are stored. This, combined with hash-based addressing (borrowed from IPFS), is all we need to solve our problem.\n\n## How Blossom Works\n\nThe Blossom protocol (Blobs Stored Simply on Mediaservers) is formally defined in a series of [BUDs](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom) (Blossom Upgrade Documents). Yes, Blossom is the most well-branded protocol in the history of protocols. Feel free to refer to the spec for details, but I will provide a high level explanation here.\n\nThe main idea behind Blossom can be summarized in three points:\n\n1. Users specify which media server(s) they use via their public Blossom settings published on Nostr;\n2. All files are uniquely addressable via hashes;\n3. If an app fails to load a file from the original URL, it simply goes to get it from the server(s) specified in the user's Blossom settings.\n\nJust like Nostr itself, the Blossom protocol is dead-simple and it works!\n\nLet's use this image as an example:\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/c1aa63f983a44185d039092912bfb7f33adcf63ed3cae371ebe6905da5f688d0.jpg)If you look at the URL for this image, you will notice that it looks like this:\n\n```\nblossom.primal.net/c1aa63f983a44185d039092912bfb7f33adcf63ed3cae371ebe6905da5f688d0.jpg\n```\n\nAll Blossom URLs follow this format:\n\n```\n[server]/[file-hash].[extension]\n```\n\nThe file hash is important because it uniquely identifies the file in question. Apps can use it to verify that the file they received is exactly the file they requested. It also gives us the ability to reliably get the same file from a different server.\n\nNostr users declare which media server(s) they use by publishing their Blossom settings. If I store my files on Server A, and they get removed, I can simply upload them to Server B, update my public Blossom settings, and all Blossom-capable apps will be able to find them at the new location. All my existing notes will continue to display media content without any issues.\n\n## Blossom Mirroring\n\nLet's face it, re-uploading files to another server after they got removed from the original server is not the best user experience. Most people wouldn't have the backups of all the files, and/or the desire to do this work.\n\nThis is where Blossom's mirroring feature comes handy. In addition to the primary media server, a Blossom user can set one one or more mirror servers. Under this setup, every time a file is uploaded to the primary server the Nostr app issues a mirror request to the primary server, directing it to copy the file to all the specified mirrors. This way there is always a copy of all content on multiple servers and in case the primary becomes unavailable, Blossom-capable apps will automatically start loading from the mirror.\n\nMirrors are *really easy* to setup (you can do it in two clicks in Primal) and this arrangement ensures robust media handling without any central points of failure. Note that you can use professional media hosting services side by side with self-hosted backup servers that anyone can run at home.\n\n## Using Blossom Within Primal\n\nBlossom is natively integrated into the entire Primal stack and enabled by default. If you are using Primal 2.2 or later, you don't need to do anything to enable Blossom, all your media uploads are blossoming already.\n\nTo enhance user privacy, all Primal apps use the \"/media\" endpoint per BUD-05, which strips all metadata from uploaded files before they are saved and optionally mirrored to other Blossom servers, per user settings. You can use any Blossom server as your primary media server in Primal, as well as setup any number of mirrors:\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/1a7e067387aba7bfffb5aedf85a03c70fe54d229c7cc343271334dff46a480cf.png)## Conclusion\n\nFor such a simple protocol, Blossom gives us three major benefits:\n\n1. **Verifiable authenticity**. All Nostr notes are always signed by the note author. With Blossom, the signed note includes a unique hash for each referenced media file, making it impossible to falsify.\n2. **File hosting redundancy**. Having multiple live copies of referenced media files (via Blossom mirroring) greatly increases the resiliency of media content published on Nostr.\n3. **Censorship resistance**. Blossom enables us to seamlessly switch media hosting providers in case of censorship.\n\nThanks for reading; and enjoy! üå∏",

      'Humans are evolving with social media & devices. These are powerful tools, but neither is built with their users\' health and well-being in mind.\n\nThe big tech business incentives are a higher priority than their users\' health & well being. This results in their products being designed to capture as much attention from you as possible so they can profit.\n\nMany are realizing this. Few know there are emerging, viable alternatives.\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/0f796d52cbd007df5f37265ae5cad7ca3052b53d295cd01064a5cd1ad71fde64.jpg "Nostr is the new model")Nostr Nostr is a new model for social media (and much more).\n\nBitcoin is a new model for money.\n\nnostr:nprofile1qyt8wumn8ghj7ct49eex2mrp09skymr99ehhyecpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mqqyr4aa6ffghhs22pmuzkrmcjhslyp56jc5y84druuddsanh238td66va34er is a new model for computers.\n\nThis article will explain why Nostr is primed to be the new model for social media.\n\n> ‚ÄúWe cannot have a society in which, if two people wish to communicate, the only way that can happen, is if it‚Äôs financed by a third party who wishes to manipulate you‚Äù - Jaron Lanier\n\n#### **What is Nostr? What is Primal?**\n\nI‚Äôve done a wonderful job of confusing people by interchanging the words Nostr & Primal. So allow me a brief, high level explanation.\n\nNostr is an internet protocol that allows for censorship resistant social media.\n\nAn internet protocol is a set of rules that computers follow to communicate with each other.\n\nNostr stands for Notes & Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays.\n\nPrimal is an app built on Nostr. I work for Primal the company.\n\nWhen you post to Primal, you can see your content in other Nostr apps. Primal doesn‚Äôt own you, your content or identity. You do. You can take your content and followers to any Nostr app.\n\nIn this gif, you can see my content in 5 different Nostr apps.\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/5fe8c5af32ca471ef9d0eb928f0a55344d4fc8d125ebeb0e4ebae0e992dc5fd4.gif "interoperability")\n\nNostr is like email, but for social media‚Äîit‚Äôs a system where anyone can send and receive posts using any app they like. Similar to how you would send an email to everyone you know. Everyone will receive that email no matter what email service provider they‚Äôre using (yahoo, gmail, proton, apple etc).\n\nWhen you ‚Äúcreate an account‚Äù on Primal, you create a password that you can use to log in to any Nostr app. Your password is called a **private key** and you can use that to log in to any apps that are built on Nostr. See them here at [nostrapps.com](http://nostrapps.com).\n\nAll this may sound a bit confusing, but this is just what\'s going on under the hood. Primal will feel like any other social media app. Check out this image below to learn more and be sure to keep your private key (your password) safe!\n\n###### ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdTWy79mJ-_dvJHB_5Slib_e1fZJcbIzByKoGZJtBGeOCQpVToMPPSztYdjMKvFbPfeIHKIesuZUgbelDADDTMAGvyF8m4ml39HiotGVmx9TlvcdJzAZ6IM8EPevvfmbifCeDVf?key=KgIOJzJwmutN8x9jsB6ML03M)**How I got into Nostr**\n\nLong story short, if you‚Äôve been in to Bitcoin, you at least know about Nostr. I used Twitter as my primary news/Bitcoin source for the past 8 years and followed the Trump and Covid dramas closely.¬†\n\nI‚Äôve come to the conclusion that social media needs to be protocol based and decentralized.\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/314d2c715242e5ed53eedf26ad1330f2c376456d6a83ef7160166c8c909a76d8.png)The first Nostr conference in March of 2023 was in Uvita, Costa Rica. I was living in the area, so of course I showed up. Here‚Äôs a brief video we made from the [conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpVcgM5_Y4).\n\n# **Why I\'m Stoked on Nostr**\n\n#### The Everything App for Social Media\n\nThis is the original idea that made the lightbulb in my head go off. 1 identity for all types of content.\n\nI have accounts on Youtube, Twitter, Nostr, Instagram, TikTok, & Medium. That means 6 different logins, 6 different follower sets, and 6 places to post when I have something to share.\n\nWith Nostr, I have 1 identity, 1 follower set, & (potentially) 1 place to post each type of content.\n\nOn the Left - 5 apps, 5 identities. Right - 5 apps, 1 identity\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/4d68ebb3676a74229a507dd5357a50c3460ce4da45209b886ce3932c710b60db.gif "nostr vs mainstream social media")\n\nNostr apps are in their infancy, but I can imagine a future with more diverse apps specified by content type (blogs, long form vid, vertical vids, music, etc.).\n\nThe ability to post all of your content to (potentially) one app and giving your audience the choice to consume that content in whatever app they please is revolutionary.\n\nX wants to be the everything app as well. It looks like it\'s heading towards becoming the WeChat of the West. This begs the question... Does the infrastructure for social media need to be owned by singular corporations or governments?\n\nCheck out this video where nostr:nprofile1qyxhwumn8ghj7mn0wvhxcmmvqyehwumn8ghj7mnhvvh8qunfd4skctnwv46z7ctewe4xcetfd3khsvrpdsmk5vnsw96rydr3v4jrz73hvyu8xqpqsg6plzptd64u62a878hep2kev88swjh3tw00gjsfl8f237lmu63q8dzj6n & nostr:nprofile1qyt8wumn8ghj7ct5d3shxtnwdaehgu3wd3skueqpz4mhxue69uhk2er9dchxummnw3ezumrpdejqqgyymmnwvah9hdnmft2wqsk0wr9as6q32hd4xk2zlnr2q5ectznjgqd27v94 discuss [everything apps](https://youtu.be/Ybe09ImCnvk?si=77FZZbVidaMipO0d) during the 2nd Nostr conference in Japan.\n\n#### Nostr is **the tool** to orange pill the world\n\nOrange pilling is a slightly cringe term used to describe educating people about Bitcoin. In Nostr, we say purple pilling because for some reason, Nostr‚Äôs theme is purple.\n\nJargon aside, the reason I believe that Nostr will orange pill the world is because of zaps!\n\nZaps are micropayments of bitcoin. You can send zaps on posts as easily as you can send likes on posts with Primal‚Äôs built in wallet and creators keep 100% of what they earn. They‚Äôre the best way to really feel the Nostr difference.¬†\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of me zapping 210 [sats](https://strike.me/es/learn/what-are-satoshis/) to a few people with one click.\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/23d722bbd524717e9e430dad61e3a52b664fe8ed7c7750d8459693a55d862db8.gif "example zaps")\n\nI\'ve now personally watched over 20 people receive and send their1st Bitcoin transactions minutes after downloading Primal. Right away you pop two cherries, owning Bitcoin and sending Bitcoin. Pretty rad.¬†\n\nIt\'s a fundamentally different experience to touch Bitcoin through a social media style app than it is to buy bitcoin from an exchange. Someone new on Primal immediately has a use case for Bitcoin upon downloading the app. Zaps!\n\nNostr is known as the Bitcoiner social network. It could be/is becoming the place for newbies to come learn about Bitcoin, and interact with people who can help teach.¬†I see a massive opportunity for Primal to play a huge role in this transition to a bitcoin standard.\n\nI wonder how often this scenario with nostr:nprofile1qyxhwumn8ghj7mn0wvhxcmmvqyv8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68ytn0wpjku6r0danxgtnwdsqzpq8gr333mlm73rnsfv2uvsrtvg44l5l5r0qrn6c0fw08t5hkccwarhnfev will repeat.

You cannot unsee or unfeel this. We\'re only beginning to scratch the surface of what zaps mean to a social network. Should be fun :)\n\n#### **Sovereignty**¬†\n\nToday, our digital lives are owned. Our data, identity, and content can be taken away.\n\nNostr flips this. We own our identity & choose where our data lives. Companies no longer have singular control over the flow of information.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdvzkSuForJ8qQBmHow8DZX1ZwJBAmTHNluU1SS-PI89G6tEu3wh5a0io2QwUY3irpUiUtjHCIwnSzevi4sPlyI3DwwDFbvzMuFgPU_K9_CDHafJ3F7hmA_y-pNPjvO6MQTNMnv_g?key=KgIOJzJwmutN8x9jsB6ML03M)Bitcoin gives you private keys for money. Nostr gives you private keys for speech.\n\nOn X and Instagram, we make a username and password. We are renting these identities from these corporations. How do we know these identities are not yours? Because they can be taken away from you.\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/640dc5ff0b42ca81c225e97405a3fd19ac72b4b3850c7f11458fe9a64b1b71cf.png "hold your own keys")With Nostr, you and only you have your keys. You can¬†**post anytime, from any app**, using your own key. If Primal stops working, no big deal. You could post from other Nostr apps.\n\nI believe there‚Äôs something deeper going on here. Humans are sovereign beings. Being sovereign means being in full control.¬†\n\nWith Nostr & Bitcoin, we can be in complete control of our money & speech.¬†\n\nThese tools empower humans and reduce our need for dependence on 3rd parties.\n\n¬†Nostr allows us to create & share freely without the potential of being silenced for ‚Äúwrongthink‚Äù.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs time for those who care about sovereignty to build their brands on their own land.\n\n#### Nostr is Organic\n\nFacebook wanted to connect the world. They‚Äôve done an absolutely fantastic job at this. But at what cost?¬†\n\nThe ad model has been the best way for platforms to monetize their services. This leads to bad incentives. Social media sites need you to spend as much time as possible on their apps so that they can sell your attention to advertisers.¬†\n\nMaybe there‚Äôs more ethical ways to advertise that do not lead to perverse incentives, but this isn‚Äôt the point.¬†\n\nNow, social media is basically a dopamine slot machine serving us things that we‚Äôre most likely to engage with. Whatever we lend our eyes to, purposefully or not, is the content we‚Äôre fed.¬†Engagement is the north star of current social media. This modifies the behavior of everyone on the app.¬†\n\nThese algorithms have been weaponized at times. And many would say that they‚Äôre [programming](https://x.com/primal_app/status/1890017190071713933) [us](https://primal.net/e/nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzpqzmxnms3qmalvl87pvpttzhvptyv29434dqe6peejakaumzp7krqqsdjyuvdnzcwssm8avnfdx68zmf7m2230jj0jvvfecgwmd25qmufrchlh3ph)[.](https://www.instagram.com/p/DD4Q6ubq1DE/)\n\nLet me speak in meme for a moment here:\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/67c7a34d2b6895864010fd3701cdab62c827e05eb2ed037e21aeed0ba39d62f8.png)![](https://blossom.primal.net/1845b8f1f4a0144bc8b120f0b77808e1fd66ddb959273905576853f85b75edb2.jpg "walle")**It‚Äôs different on Nostr**\n\nAfter using Nostr for a couple years, it‚Äôs clearer to me when I switch to another social media platform that they are doing everything they can to grab my attention. They being the platform and the creators. I can feel when people create for an algo vs. for an audience.¬†\n\nWith Primal, I can select which algorithm I want to use or create my own feeds using [\\<u>Primal‚Äôs advanced search\\</u>](https://youtu.be/TDw_KN-OYOw?feature=shared). (I expect these tools to get much better over time.) This gives the user much more control over what they see vs a singular algorithm. Algorithmic choice is something that legacy social media platforms are greatly missing.¬†¬†\n\nI can also control which feed I want to see when I open the app. For example, I created this feed of one person saying ‚ÄúSTAY FOCUSED CHAMP‚Äù so when I open the app I‚Äôm not immediately distracted.¬† Look at what instagram does when you want to simply search for someone‚Äôs account‚Ä¶\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeeSzpunDFd2REsClmc5muRZVaUdYNjNtfmo1XSL1leDMQtjglrHd3nsNWcoBCQ1YPchPrPReHJTH2KVCYNcNY7eWvxve3sMm_3beSKoVNtOOaWWloBYy34aUAAtBfC-K-kIlnQ7w?key=KgIOJzJwmutN8x9jsB6ML03M)I can‚Äôt help but envision a world where all of the content is posted to Nostr. The apps with the best user experiences would win. I‚Äôd imagine the winners would have the best algos, least intrusive ads, and would give their users **the most control** over their experience.\n\n#### Thought Experiment\n\nPretend you‚Äôre a super intelligent being looking down upon the earth.¬†\n\nThe1st thing you‚Äôd notice is that they‚Äôre always staring at their phones. You‚Äôd also notice that while they have an abundant earth, they insist on chemically altering their food which is making them sick.¬†\n\nThen, you‚Äôd notice that the money humans work their entire lives for can be and is manipulated by central authorities with zero effort.¬†\n\nAnd, you‚Äôd notice that the ‚Äúdigital global town square‚Äù is owned by a unelected, fallable humans and corporations.\\\nIt‚Äôs laughable!¬†\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt have to be this way anymore. And it‚Äôs up to us to change it.\n\n#### To conclude.¬†\n\nThis article is not meant to trash talk other platforms, those who use them, or those who created them. I use them daily. Mostly to advocate for Nostr & Bitcoin these days.\n\nThese platforms have created a ton of value for the world, & Nostr can be used alongside of them.\n\nMaybe if Nostr existed back then, they would‚Äôve built on it.¬†\n\n‚ÄúWe shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us‚Äù. We‚Äôve learned priceless lessons from the evolution of social media thus far. We can use these lessons to shape tools with our health & well-being as our first priority.¬†\n\nWe can obsolete these outdated, unhealthy systems.¬†\n\n*Nostro* and *Nuestro* mean \'ours\' in Italian & Spanish. I don\'t think this a coincidence.

      "There‚Äôs a lot of conversation around the #TwitterFiles. Here‚Äôs my take, and thoughts on how to fix the issues identified.\n\nI‚Äôll start with the principles I‚Äôve come to believe‚Ä¶based on everything I‚Äôve learned and experienced through my past actions as a Twitter co-founder and lead:\n\n1. Social media must be resilient to corporate and government control.\n2. Only the original author may remove content they produce.\n3. Moderation is best implemented by algorithmic choice.\n\nThe Twitter when I led it and the Twitter of today do not meet any of these principles. This is my fault alone, as I completely gave up pushing for them when an activist entered our stock in 2020. I no longer had hope of achieving any of it as a public company with no defense mechanisms (lack of dual-class shares being a key one). I planned my exit at that moment knowing I was no longer right for the company.\n\nThe biggest mistake I made was continuing to invest in building tools for us to manage the public conversation, versus building tools for the people using Twitter to easily manage it for themselves. This burdened the company with too much power, and opened us to significant outside pressure (such as advertising budgets). I generally think companies have become far too powerful, and that became completely clear to me with our suspension of Trump‚Äôs account. As I‚Äôve said before, we did the right thing for the public company business at the time, but the wrong thing for the internet and society. Much more about this here: https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690\n\nI continue to believe there was no ill intent or hidden agendas, and everyone acted according to the best information we had at the time. Of course mistakes were made. But if we had focused more on tools for the people using the service rather than tools for us, and moved much faster towards absolute transparency, we probably wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation of needing a fresh reset (which I am supportive of). Again, I own all of this and our actions, and all I can do is work to make it right.\n\nBack to the principles. Of course governments want to shape and control the public conversation, and will use every method at their disposal to do so, including the media. And the power a corporation wields to do the same is only growing. It‚Äôs critical that the people have tools to resist this, and that those tools are ultimately owned by the people. Allowing a government or a few corporations to own the public conversation is a path towards centralized control.\n\nI‚Äôm a strong believer that any content produced by someone for the internet should be permanent until the original author chooses to delete it. It should be always available and addressable. Content takedowns and suspensions should not be possible. Doing so complicates important context, learning, and enforcement of illegal activity. There are significant issues with this stance of course, but starting with this principle will allow for far better solutions than we have today. The internet is trending towards a world were storage is ‚Äúfree‚Äù and infinite, which places all the actual value on how to discover and see content.\n\nWhich brings me to the last principle: moderation. I don‚Äôt believe a centralized system can do content moderation globally. It can only be done through ranking and relevance algorithms, the more localized the better. But instead of a company or government building and controlling these solely, people should be able to build and choose from algorithms that best match their criteria, or not have to use any at all. A ‚Äúfollow‚Äù action should always deliver every bit of content from the corresponding account, and the algorithms should be able to comb through everything else through a relevance lens that an individual determines. There‚Äôs a default ‚ÄúG-rated‚Äù algorithm, and then there‚Äôs everything else one can imagine.\n\nThe only way I know of to truly live up to these 3 principles is a free and open protocol for social media, that is not owned by a single company or group of companies, and is resilient to corporate and government influence. The problem today is that we have companies who own both the protocol and discovery of content. Which ultimately puts one person in charge of what‚Äôs available and seen, or not. This is by definition a single point of failure, no matter how great the person, and over time will fracture the public conversation, and may lead to more control by governments and corporations around the world. \n\nI believe many companies can build a phenomenal business off an open protocol. For proof, look at both the web and email. The biggest problem with these models however is that the discovery mechanisms are far too proprietary and fixed instead of open or extendable. Companies can build many profitable services that complement rather than lock down how we access this massive collection of conversation. There is no need to own or host it themselves.\n\nMany of you won‚Äôt trust this solution just because it‚Äôs me stating it. I get it, but that‚Äôs exactly the point. Trusting any one individual with this comes with compromises, not to mention being way too heavy a burden for the individual. It has to be something akin to what bitcoin has shown to be possible. If you want proof of this, get out of the US and European bubble of the bitcoin price fluctuations and learn how real people are using it for censorship resistance in Africa and Central/South America.\n\nI do still wish for Twitter, and every company, to become uncomfortably transparent in all their actions, and I wish I forced more of that years ago. I do believe absolute transparency builds trust. As for the files, I wish they were released Wikileaks-style, with many more eyes and interpretations to consider. And along with that, commitments of transparency for present and future actions. I‚Äôm hopeful all of this will happen. There‚Äôs nothing to hide‚Ä¶only a lot to learn from. The current attacks on my former colleagues could be dangerous and doesn‚Äôt solve anything. If you want to blame, direct it at me and my actions, or lack thereof.\n\nAs far as the free and open social media protocol goes, there are many competing projects: @bluesky is one with the AT Protocol, nostr another, Mastodon yet another, Matrix yet another‚Ä¶and there will be many more. One will have a chance at becoming a standard like HTTP or SMTP. This isn‚Äôt about a ‚Äúdecentralized Twitter.‚Äù This is a focused and urgent push for a foundational core technology standard to make social media a native part of the internet. I believe this is critical both to Twitter‚Äôs future, and the public conversation‚Äôs ability to truly serve the people, which helps hold governments and corporations accountable. And hopefully makes it all a lot more fun and informative again.\n\nüí∏üõ†Ô∏èüåê\nTo accelerate open internet and protocol work, I‚Äôm going to open a new category of #startsmall grants: ‚Äúopen internet development.‚Äù It will start with a focus of giving cash and equity grants to engineering teams working on social media and private communication protocols, bitcoin, and a web-only mobile OS. I‚Äôll make some grants next week, starting with $1mm/yr to Signal. Please let me know other great candidates for this money.",

      "*by Evan Henshaw-Plath ‚Äî aka Rabble*\n\nEarlier this year, I was a part of a CNN documentary, [*Twitter: Breaking the Bird*](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/tech/twitter-x-history-breaking-the-bird/index.html), which gave me much pause for reflection about the state of social media and how we got here. This year alone we‚Äôve witnessed an unprecedented wave of disruption across these platforms.\n\nGovernment workers, locked out of their jobs, struggled to organize securely. Protestors seeking to plan No Kings marches, wondered which app could be the most trusted. Inbound international travelers have been deleting their social apps for fear that immigration officers will search their phones. And during major disasters, like the tragic Texas floods and the LA fires, emergency responders and volunteers find their critical updates buried by algorithms that prioritize engagement over urgency. On a daily basis, countless online communities face arbitrary deplatforming, surveillance, and loss of their digital spaces without recourse or explanation.\n\nThese aren‚Äôt isolated incidents: they‚Äôre symptoms of a fundamental crisis in how we‚Äôve allowed our digital communities to be governed. We‚Äôve unwittingly accepted a system where massive corporations control the public sphere; algorithms optimize for advertising revenue rather than human connection, and we the people have no real agency over our digital existence.\n\n# **We‚Äôve Lost Our Way**\n\nI‚Äôve spent decades building social technologies, including working at Odeo, the company that ultimately pivoted to become Twitter. There I was the social app‚Äôs first employee and de facto CTO until late 2006; and have since built numerous other community organizing platforms.\n\nI‚Äôve watched with growing concern as our digital spaces have become increasingly toxic and hostile to genuine community needs. The promise of social media as we defined it in the early days ‚Äî to connect and empower communities of people ‚Äî has been subverted by a business model that treats human connection as a commodity to be monetized.\n\nToday, if you run a Facebook Group with thousands of members, you have no real authority ‚Äî your community exists at the whim of corporate policies you cannot influence. This is fundamentally at odds with how real-world communities have always operated. Your local gardening club, bowling league, or neighborhood association, has democratic processes for leadership and decision-making. Why should our digital communities be any different?\n\n# **It‚Äôs Time For a New Social Media Bill Of Digital Rights**\n\nI believe that the time has come for a new Social Media Bill of Digital Rights. Just as the original Bill of Rights protected individual freedoms from government overreach, we need fundamental protections for our digital communities from corporate control and surveillance capitalism.\n\nSo what could such a [*Social Media Bill of Rights*](http://revolution.social/) include?\n\n1. **The right to privacy & security:** The ability to communicate and organize without fear of surveillance or exploitation.\n\n2. **The right to own and control your identity:&#x20;**&#x50;eople and their communities must own their digital identities, connections and data. And, as the owner of an account, you can exercise the right to be forgotten.\n\n3. **The right to choose and understand algorithms (transparency):** Choosing the algorithms that shape your interactions: no more black box systems optimizing for engagement at the expense of community well-being.\n\n4. **The right to community self-governance**: Crucially, communities of users need the right to self-govern, setting their own rules for behaviour which are contextually relevant to their community. (Note: this does not preclude developer governance.)\n\n5. **The right to full portability ‚Äî the right to exit:&#x20;**&#x54;he freedom to port your community in its entirety, to another app without losing your connections and content.\n\nTo determine whether these are the appropriate ‚ÄúRights‚Äù, I‚Äôve just launched a new podcast, [*Revolution.Social*](http://Revolution.Social) where I invite my guests, including the likes of Jack Dorsey, Cory Doctorow, Yoel Roth, Kara Swisher and Renee DiResta, to share their feedback and debate where we need to head next.\n\n# **Architecting For A Better Future**\n\nThe good news is that the technical foundations for a better future already exist through open protocols that work like the web itself ‚Äî interconnected and controlled by no single entity.\n\n* The Fediverse, powered by ActivityPub, enables platforms like Mastodon to create interconnected communities free from corporate control.\n\n* Nostr provides a foundation for decentralized, encrypted communication that no one can shut down.\n\n* BlueSky is pioneering user choice in algorithms.\n\n* Signal demonstrates that private, secure communication is possible at scale.\n\nUnlike the walled gardens of Meta, TikTok, and Twitter (now X), these open protocols allow communities to connect across platforms while maintaining control of their spaces. When you use email or browse the web, you don‚Äôt worry about which email provider or browser your friends use ‚Äî it just works. Our social spaces should function the same way.\n\nWhat‚Äôs missing is the bridge between these technical capabilities and the tools communities actually need to thrive. We need to move from closed, corporate platforms to open protocols that communities can shape and control. This isn‚Äôt just a technical challenge ‚Äî it needs to become a social movement. We need to build systems that are co-designed with communities, that respect their autonomy, and that enable their authentic purposes.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a utopian vision ‚Äî it‚Äôs an extension of how human communities have always worked. The gardening club raises money for soil and seeds. The sailing club maintains boats for teaching kids. Communities have always had the ability to self-organize, self-govern, and self-fund. We simply need to bring these proven models into our digital spaces.\n\n# **How You Can Begin To Make Change Happen**\n\nThe path forward begins with understanding that we are not passive consumers of social media ‚Äî we are active participants in shaping its future.\n\nStart by exploring and supporting open protocols and platforms. Join communities on Nostr, Mastodon or BlueSky. Demand transparency and control from the services you use. Join the growing movement of technologists, activists, and community leaders working to build better digital spaces.\n\nWe deserve better than what today‚Äôs social media platforms offer. We have the technical knowledge, the social understanding, and the urgent necessity to build something better. The question is no longer whether we can create more equitable and empowering digital spaces ‚Äî it‚Äôs whether we will choose to do so.\n\nThe moment for this transformation is now. As our lives become increasingly digital, we cannot afford to leave our communities at the mercy of corporate platforms and profit-driven algorithms. We must reclaim our digital spaces and establish the fundamental rights that will allow our communities to truly thrive in the digital age.\n\nWatch this space: I‚Äôm actively working with other community leaders to build better tools for our digital communities, as [*this recent article in Techcrunch*](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/jack-dorsey-pumps-10m-into-a-nonprofit-focused-on-open-source-social-media/) describes.\n\n*Note*: this article also appears in Techdirt.\n",

      "Not too long ago, I tried to paint a picture of what a [vision for a value-enabled web][vew] could look like. Now, only a couple of months later, all this stuff is being built. On nostr, and on lightning. Orange and purple, a match made in heaven.\n\nIt goes without saying that I'm beyond delighted. What a time to be alive!\n\n## nostr\n\nHere's the thing that nostr got right, and it's the same thing that Bitcoin got right: information is easy to spread and hard to stifle.[^fn-stifle] Information can be copied quickly and perfectly, which is, I believe, the underlying reason for its desire to be free.\n\n[^fn-stifle]: That's a [Satoshi quote][stifle], of course: \"Bitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for double-spending. In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin. It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle.\"\n\n[stifle]: https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/p2pfoundation/1/\n\nEasy to spread, hard to stifle. That's the base reality of the nature of information. As always, the smart thing is to work with nature, not against it.[^1] That's what's beautiful about the orange coin and the purple ostrich: both manage to work with the peculiarities of information, not against them. Both realize that information can and should be copied, as it can be perfectly read and easily spread, always. Both understand that resistance to censorship comes from writing to many places, making the cost of deletion prohibitive.\n\n> Information does not just want to be free,\n> it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available\n> storage space. Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin;\n> Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and\n> understands less than Rumor.\n>\n> <cite>Eric Hughes, [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto][manifesto]</cite>\n\n[manifesto]: https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt\n\nNostr is quickly establishing itself as a base layer for information exchange, one that is identity-native and value-enabled. It is distinctly different from systems that came before it, just like Bitcoin is distinctly different from monies that came before it.\n\nAs of today, the focus of nostr is mostly on short text notes, the so-called \"type 1\" events more commonly known as *tweets*.[^fn-kinds] However, as you should be aware by now, nostr is way more than just an alternative to twitter. It is a new paradigm. Change the note kind from `1` to `30023` and you don't have an alternative to Twitter, but a replacement for Medium, Substack, and all the other long-form platforms. I believe that special-purpose clients that focus on certain content types will emerge over time, just like we have seen the emergence of special-purpose platforms in the Web 2.0 era. This time, however, the network effects are cumulative, not separate. A new paradigm.\n\nLet me now turn to one such special-purpose client, a nostr-based reading app.\n\n[^fn-kinds]: Refer to the various NIPs to discover the multitude of [event kinds][kinds] defined by the protocol.\n\n[kinds]: https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips#event-kinds\n[nip23]: https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/23.md\n\n## Reading\n\nI'm constantly surprised that, even though most people do read a lot online, very few people seem to have a reading workflow or reading tools.\n\nWhy that is is anyone's guess, but maybe the added value of such tools is not readily apparent. You can just read the stuff right there, on the ad-ridden, dead-ugly site, right? Why should you sign up for another site, use another app, or bind yourself to another closed platform?\n\nThat's a fair point, but the success of Medium and Substack shows that there is an appetite for clean reading and writing, as well as providing avenues for authors to get paid for their writing (and a willingness of readers to support said authors, just because).\n\nThe problem is, of course, that all of these platforms are¬†*platforms*, which is to say, walled gardens that imprison readers and writers alike. Worse than that: they are fiat platforms, which means that permissionless value-flows are not only absent from their DNA, they are outright impossible.[^2]\n\nNostr fixes this.\n\n![Nostriches like to read, or so I've heard](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-04-04-purple-text-orange-highlights/nostrich-reading-a-newspaper.jpg)\n\nThe beauty of nostr is that it is not a platform. It's a protocol, which means that you don't have to sign up for it---you can create an identity yourself. You don't have to ask for permission; you just *do*, without having to rely on the benevolence of whatever dictator is in charge of the platform right now.\n\nNostr is¬†*not*¬†a platform, and yet, powerful tools and services can be built and monetized on top of it. This is good for users, good for service providers, and good for the network(s) at large. Win-win-win.\n\nSo what am I talking about, exactly? How can nostr improve everyone's reading (and writing) experience?\n\nAllow me to paint a (rough) picture of what I have in mind. Nostr already supports private and public bookmarks, so let's start from there.\n\nImagine a special-purpose client that scans all your bookmarks for long-form content.[^fn-urls] Everything that you marked to be read later is shown in an orderly fashion, which is to say searchable, sortable, filterable, and displayed without distractions.  Voil√†, you have yourself a reading app. That's, in essence, how Pocket, Readwise, and other reading apps work. But all these apps are walled gardens without much interoperability and without direct monetization.\n\n[^fn-urls]: In the nostr world long-form content is simply markdown as defined in [NIP-23][nip23], but it could also be a link to an article or PDF, which in turn could get [converted into markdown][readability] and posted as an event to a special relay.\n\n[readability]: https://github.com/mozilla/readability\n\nBitcoin fixes the direct monetization part.[^fn-v4v] Nostr fixes the interoperability part.\n\n[^fn-v4v]: ...because Bitcoin makes [V4V][busking] practical. (Paywalls are not the way.)\n\nAlright, we got ourselves a boring reading app. Great. Now, imagine that users are able to highlight passages. These highlights, just like bookmarks now, could be private or public. When shared publicly, something interesting emerges: an overlay on existing content, a lens on the written Web. In other words:¬†*swarm highlights*.\n\nImagine a visual overlay of all public highlights, automatically shining a light on what the swarm of readers found most useful, insightful, funny, etc.\n\n![Swarm Highlights](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-04-04-purple-text-orange-highlights/highlights.png)\n\nFurther, imagine the possibility of sharing these highlights as a¬†\"type 1\"¬†event with one click, automatically tagging the highlighter(s)---as well as the author, of course---so that eventual sat-flows can be split and forwarded automatically.\n\n![Automated value splits](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-04-04-purple-text-orange-highlights/sat-flows.png)\n\nVoil√†, you have a system that allows for value to flow back to those who provide it, be it authors, editors, curators, or readers that willingly slog through the information jungle to share and highlight the best stuff (which is a form of curation, of course).\n\nZaps make nostr a defacto address book[^fn-pp] of payment information, which is to say lightning addresses, as of now. Thanks to [nostr wallet connect][nwc] (among other developments), sending sats ~~will soon be~~ is already as frictionless as leaving a like.\n\n[^fn-pp]: The Yellow Pages are dead, long live [The Purple Pages](http://purplepag.es/)!\n\nValue-for-value and participatory payment flows are something that traditional reading apps desperately lack, be it Pocket, Instapaper, Readwise, or the simple reading mode that is part of every browser.\n\nA neat side-effect of a more structured way to share passages of text is that it enables semi-structured discussions around said passages---which could be another useful overlay inside special-purpose clients, providing context and further insights.[^5]\n\nFurther, imagine the option of seamlessly switching from text-on-screen to text-to-speech, allowing the user to stream sats if desired, as Podcasting 2.0 clients already do.[^3]\n\nImagine user-built curations of the best articles of the week, bundled neatly for your reading pleasure, incentivized by a small value split that allows the curator to participate in the flow of sats.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nI'm sure that the various implementation details will be hashed out,\nbut as I see it, 90% of the stuff is already there. Maybe we'll need\nanother NIP or two, but I don't see a reason why this can't be\nbuilt---and, more importantly: I don't see a reason why it wouldn't\nbe sustainable for everyone involved.\n\nMost puzzle pieces are already there, and the rest of them can probably\nbe implemented by custom event types. From the point of view of nostr,\nmost everything is an event: bookmarks are events, highlights are\nevents, marking something as read is an event, and sharing an excerpt or\na highlight is an event. Public actions are out in the open, private\nactions are encrypted, the data is not in a silo, and everyone wins.\nEspecially the users, those who are at the edge of the network and\nusually lose out on the value generated.\n\nIn this case, the reading case, the users are mostly \"consumers\" of\ncontent. What changes from the producing perspective, the perspective of\nthe writer?\n\n## Writing\n\nBack to the one thing that nostr got right: information is easy to\nspread but hard to stifle. In addition to that, digital information can\nbe copied perfectly, which is why it shouldn't matter where stuff is\npublished in the first place.\n\nAllow me to repeat this point in all caps, for emphasis:¬†**IT SHOULD NOT\nMATTER WHERE INFORMATION IS PUBLISHED**, and, maybe even more\nimportantly, it shouldn't matter if it is published in a hundred\ndifferent places at once.[^fn-torrents]\n\nWhat matters is trust and accuracy, which is to say, digital signatures\nand reputation. To translate this to nostr speak: because every event is\nsigned by default, as long as you trust the person behind the signature,\nit doesn't matter from which relay the information is fetched.\n\nThis is already true (or mostly true) on the regular web. Whether you\nread the internet archive version of an article or the version that is\npublished by an online magazine, the version on the author's website,\nor the version read by some guy that has read more about Bitcoin than\nanyone else you know[^fn-guy]---it's all the same, essentially. What matters\nis the information itself.\n\n[^fn-guy]: There is only one such guy, as we all know, and it's this Guy: nostr:npub1h8nk2346qezka5cpm8jjh3yl5j88pf4ly2ptu7s6uu55wcfqy0wq36rpev\n\nPractically speaking, the source of truth in a hypernostrized world is---you\nguessed it---an event. An event signed by the author, which allows for\nthe information to be wrapped in a tamper-proof manner, which in turn\nallows the information to spread far and wide---without it being\nhosted in one place.\n\nThe first clients that focus on long-form content already exist, and I expect\nmore clients to pop up over time.[^4] As mentioned before, one could easily\nimagine [prism-like value splits][prism] seamlessly integrated into these\nclients, splitting zaps automatically to compensate writers, editors,\nproofreaders, and illustrators in a V4V fashion. Further, one could imagine\nvarious compute-intensive services built into these special-purpose clients,\nsuch as GPT Ghostwriters, or writing aids such as Grammarly and the like. All\nthese services could be seamlessly paid for in sats, without the requirement of\nany sign-ups or the gathering of any user data. That's the beauty of [money\nproper][rediscovery].\n\n![A clean and simple reading and writing interface](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-04-04-purple-text-orange-highlights/nostr-reader-and-writer.png)\n\nPlagiarism is one issue that needs to be dealt with, of course. Humans\nare greedy, and some humans are assholes. Neither bitcoin nor nostr\nfixes this. However, while plagiarism detection is not necessarily\ntrivial, it is also not impossible, especially if most texts are\npublished on nostr first. Nostr-based publishing tools allow for\nOpenTimestamp attestations thanks\nto¬†[NIP-03](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/03.md),\nwhich in turn allows for plagiarism detection based on \"first seen\"\nlookups.\n\nThat's just one way to deal with the problem, of course. In any case,\nI'm confident that we'll figure it out.\n\n## Value\n\nI believe that in the open ~~attention~~ information economy we find\nourselves in, value will mostly derive from effective curation,\ndissemination, and transmission of information, *not* the exclusive\nownership of it.\n\nAlthough it is still early days,\nthe¬†[statistics](https://stats.podcastindex.org/v4v)¬†around Podcasting\n2.0 and¬†[nostr zaps](https://zaplife.lol/)¬†clearly show that (a) people\nare willing to monetarily reward content they care about, and (b) the\nwillingness to send sats *increases* as friction *decreases*.\n\nThe ingenious thing about boostagrams and zaps is that they are direct\nand visible, which is to say, public and interactive. They are neither\nregular transactions nor simple donations---they are something else\nentirely. An unforgable value signal, a special form of gratitude and\nappreciation.\n\nContrast that with a link to Paypal or Patreon: impersonal, slow,\nindirect, and friction-laden. It's the opposite of a super-charged\ninteraction.\n\nWhile today's information jungle increasingly presents itself in the\nform of (short) videos and (long-form) audio, I believe that we will see\na renaissance of the written word, especially if we manage to move away\nfrom an economy built around attention, towards an economy built upon\nvalue and insight.\n\nThe orange future now has a purple hue, and I believe that it will be as\nbright as ever. We just have a lot of building to do.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [A Vision for a Value-Enabled Web][vew]\n- [The Freedom of Value][busking]\n- [The Rediscovery of Money][prism]\n- [Lightning Prisms][rediscovery]\n\n[vew]: https://dergigi.com/vew\n[prism]: https://dergigi.com/prism\n[rediscovery]: https://dergigi.com/rediscovery\n[busking]: https://dergigi.com/busking\n\n## NIPs and Resources\n\n- [Nostr Resources][nr]\n- [value4value.info](https://value4value.info/)\n- [nips.be](https://nips.be/)\n- [NIP-23: Long-form content](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/23.md)\n- [NIP-57: Event-specific zap markers](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md)\n- [NIP-47: Nostr Wallet Connect](https://github.com/getAlby/nips/blob/master/47.md)\n- [NIP-03: OpenTimestamps attestations for events](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/03.md)\n\nOriginally published on [dergigi.com](https://dergigi.com/reader)\n\n---\n\n[^1]: Paywalls work against this nature, which is why I consider them misguided at best and incredibly retarded at worst.\n\n[^2]: Fiat doesn't work for the [value-enabled web][vew], as fiat rails can never be open and permissionless.

      'So you\'ve decided to join nostr! Some wide-eyed fanatic has convinced you that the "sun shines every day on the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees" in a magical land of decentralized, censorship-resistant freedom of speech - and it\'s waiting just over the next hill.\n\nBut your experience has not been all you hoped. Before you\'ve even had a chance to upload your AI-generated cyberpunk avatar or make up exploit codenames for your pseudonym\'s bio, you\'ve been confronted with a new concept that has left you completely nonplussed.\n\nIt doesn\'t help that this new idea might be called by any number of strange names. You may have been asked to "paste your nsec", "generate a private key", "enter your seed words", "connect with a bunker", "sign in with extension", or even "generate entropy". Sorry about that.\n\nAll these terms are really referring to one concept under many different names: that of "cryptographic identity".\n\nNow, you may have noticed that I just introduced yet another new term which explains exactly nothing. You\'re absolutely correct. And now I\'m going to proceed to ignore your complaints and talk about something completely different. But bear with me, because the juice is worth the squeeze.\n\n# Identity\n\nWhat is identity? There are many philosophical, political, or technical answers to this question, but for our purposes it\'s probably best to think of it this way:\n\n> Identity is the essence of a thing. Identity separates one thing from all others, and is itself indivisible.\n\nThis definition has three parts:\n\n- Identity is "essential": a thing can change, but its identity cannot. I might re-paint my house, replace its components, sell it, or even burn it down, but its identity as something that can be referred to - "this house" - is durable, even outside the boundaries of its own physical existence.\n- Identity is a unit: you can\'t break an identity into multiple parts. A thing might be _composed_ of multiple parts, but that\'s only incidental to the identity of a thing, which is a _concept_, not a material thing.\n- Identity is distinct: identity is what separates one thing from all others - the concept of an apple can\'t be mixed with that of an orange; the two ideas are distinct. In the same way, a single concrete apple is distinct in identity from another - even if the component parts of the apple decompose into compost used to grow more apples.\n\nIdentity is not a physical thing, but a metaphysical thing. Or, in simpler terms, identity is a "concept".\n\nI (or someone more qualified) could at this point launch into a Scholastic tangent on what "is" is, but that is, fortunately, not necessary here. The kind of identities I want to focus on here are not our _actual_ identities as people, but entirely _fictional_ identities that we use to extend our agency into the digital world.\n\nThink of it this way - your bank login does not represent _you_ as a complete person. It only represents the _access granted to you_ by the bank. This access is in fact an _entirely new identity_ that has been associated with you, and is limited in what it\'s useful for.\n\nOther examples of fictional identities include:\n\n- The country you live in\n- Your social media persona\n- Your mortgage\n- Geographical coordinates\n- A moment in time\n- A chess piece\n\nSome of these identites are inert, for example points in space and time. Other identies have agency and so are able to act in the world - even as fictional concepts. In order to do this, they must "authenticate" themselves (which means "to prove they are real"), and act within a system of established rules.\n\nFor example, your D&D character exists only within the collective fiction of your D&D group, and can do anything the rules say. Its identity is authenticated simply by your claim as a member of the group that your character in fact exists. Similarly, a lawyer must prove they are a member of the Bar Association before they are allowed to practice law within that collective fiction.\n\n"Cryptographic identity" is simply another way of authenticating a fictional identity within a given system. As we\'ll see, it has some interesting attributes that set it apart from things like a library card or your latitude and longitude. Before we get there though, let\'s look in more detail at how identities are authenticated.\n\n# Certificates\n\nMerriam-Webster defines the verb "certify" as meaning "to attest authoritatively". A "certificate" is just a fancy way of saying "because I said so". Certificates are issued by a "certificate authority", someone who has the authority to "say so". Examples include your boss, your mom, or the Pope.\n\nThis method of authentication is how almost every institution authenticates the people who associate with it. Colleges issue student ID cards, governments issue passports, and websites allow you to "register an account".\n\nIn every case mentioned above, the "authority" creates a closed system in which a document (aka a "certificate") is issued which serves as a claim to a given identity. When someone wants to access some privileged service, location, or information, they present their certificate. The authority then validates it and grants or denies access. In the case of an international airport, the certificate is a little book printed with fancy inks. In the case of a login page, the certificate is a username and password combination.\n\nThis pattern for authentication is ubiquitous, and has some very important implications.\n\nFirst of all, certified authentication implies that the issuer of the certificate has the right to _exclusive control_ of any identity it issues. This identity can be revoked at any time, or its permissions may change. Your social credit score may drop arbitrarily, or money might disappear from your account. When dealing with certificate authorities, you have no inherent rights.\n\nSecond, certified authentication depends on the certificate authority continuing to exist. If you store your stuff at a storage facility but the company running it goes out of business, your stuff might disappear along with it.\n\nUsually, authentication via certificate authority works pretty well, since an appeal can always be made to a higher authority (nature, God, the government, etc). Authorities also can\'t generally dictate their terms with impunity without losing their customers, alienating their constituents, or provoking revolt. But it\'s also true that certification by authority creates an incentive structure that frequently leads to abuse - arbitrary deplatforming is increasingly common, and the bigger the certificate authority, the less recourse the certificate holder (or "subject") has.\n\nCertificates also put the issuer in a position to intermediate relationships that wouldn\'t otherwise be subject to their authority. This might take the form of selling user attention to advertisers, taking a cut of financial transactions, or selling surveillance data to third parties.\n\nProliferation of certificate authorities is not a solution to these problems. Websites and apps frequently often offer multiple "social sign-in" options, allowing their users to choose which certificate authority to appeal to. But this only piles more value into the social platform that issues the certificate - not only can Google shut down your email inbox, they can revoke your ability to log in to every website you used their identity provider to get into.\n\nIn every case, certificate issuance results in an asymmetrical power dynamic, where the issuer is able to exert significant control over the certificate holder, even in areas unrelated to the original pretext for the relationship between parties.\n\n# Self-Certification\n\nBut what if we could reverse this power dynamic? What if individuals could issue their own certificates and force institutions to accept them?\n\n![I can do what I want](https://i.gifer.com/6rj.gif)\n\nRon Swanson\'s counterexample notwithstanding, there\'s a reason I can\'t simply write myself a parking permit and slip it under the windshield wiper. Questions about voluntary submission to legitimate authorities aside, the fact is that we don\'t have the power to act without impunity - just like any other certificate authority, we have to prove our claims either by the exercise of raw power or by appeal to a higher authority.\n\nSo the question becomes: which higher authority can we appeal to in order to issue our own certificates within a given system of identity?\n\nThe obvious answer here is to go straight to the top and ask God himself to back our claim to self-sovereignty. However, that\'s not how he normally works - there\'s a reason they call direct acts of God "miracles". In fact, Romans 13:1 explicitly says that "the authorities that exist have been appointed by God". God has structured the universe in such a way that we must appeal to the deputies he has put in place to govern various parts of the world.\n\nAnother tempting appeal might be to nature - i.e. the material world. This is the realm in which we most frequently have the experience of "self-authenticating" identities. For example, a gold coin can be authenticated by biting it or by burning it with acid. If it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\n\nIn most cases however, the ability to authenticate using physical claims depends on physical access, and so appeals to physical reality have major limitations when it comes to the digital world. Captchas, selfies and other similar tricks are often used to bridge the physical world into the digital, but these are increasingly easy to forge, and hard to verify.\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule - an example of self-certification that makes its appeal to the physical world is that of a signature. Signatures are hard to forge - an incredible amount of data is encoded in physical signatures, from strength, to illnesses, to upbringing, to [personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphology). These can even be scanned and used within the digital world as well. Even today, most contracts are sealed with some simulacrum of a physical signature. Of course, this custom is quickly becoming a mere historical curiosity, since the very act of digitizing a signature makes it trivially forgeable.\n\nSo: transcendent reality is too remote to subtantiate our claims, and the material world is too limited to work within the world of information. There is another aspect of reality remaining that we might appeal to: information itself.\n\nPhysical signatures authenticate physical identities by encoding unique physical data into an easily recognizable artifact. To transpose this idea to the realm of information, a "digital signature" might authenticate "digital identities" by encoding unique "digital data" into an easily recognizable artifact.\n\nUnfortunately, in the digital world we have the additional challenge that the artifact itself can be copied, undermining any claim to legitimacy. We need something that can be easily verified _and unforgeable_.\n\n# Digital Signatures\n\nIn fact such a thing does exist, but calling it a "digital signature" obscures more than it reveals. We might just as well call the thing we\'re looking for a "digital fingerprint", or a "digital electroencephalogram". Just keep that in mind as we work our way towards defining the term - we are not looking for something _looks like a physical signature_, but for something that _does the same thing as_ a physical signature, in that it allows us to issue ourselves a credential that must be accepted by others by encoding privileged information into a recognizable, unforgeable artifact.\n\nWith that, let\'s get into the weeds.\n\nAn important idea in computer science is that of a "function". A function is a sort of information machine that converts data from one form to another. One example is the idea of "incrementing" a number. If you increment 1, you get 2. If you increment 2, you get 3. Incrementing can be reversed, by creating a complementary function that instead subtracts 1 from a number.\n\nA "one-way function" is a function that can\'t be reversed. A good example of a one-way function is integer rounding. If you round a number and get `5`, what number did you begin with? It\'s impossible to know - 5.1, 4.81, 5.332794, in fact an infinite number of numbers can be rounded to the number `5`. These numbers can also be infinitely long - for example rounding PI to the nearest integer results in the number `3`.\n\nA real-life example of a useful one-way function is `sha256`. This function is a member of a family of one-way functions called "hash functions". You can feed as much data as you like into `sha256`, and you will always get 256 bits of information out. Hash functions are especially useful because collisions between outputs are very rare - even if you change a single bit in a huge pile of data, you\'re almost certainly going to get a different output.\n\nTaking this a step further, there is a whole family of cryptographic one-way "trapdoor" functions that act similarly to hash functions, but which maintain a specific mathematical relationship between the input and the output which allows the input/output pair to be used in a variety of useful applications. For example, in Elliptic Curve Cryptography, scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve is used to derive the output.\n\n"Ok", you say, "that\'s all completely clear and lucidly explained" (thank you). "But what goes _into_ the function?" You might expect that because of our analogy to physical signatures we would have to gather an incredible amount of digital information to cram into our cryptographic trapdoor function, mashing together bank statements, a record of our heartbeat, brain waves and cellular respiration. Well, we _could_ do it that way (maybe), but there\'s actually a _much_ simpler solution.\n\nLet\'s play a quick game. What number am I thinking of? Wrong, it\'s 82,749,283,929,834. Good guess though.\n\nThe reason we use signatures to authenticate our identity in the physical world is not because they\'re backed by a lot of implicit physical information, but because they\'re hard to forge and easy to validate. Even so, there is a lot of variation in a single person\'s signature, even from one moment to the next.\n\nTrapdoor functions solve the validation problem - it\'s trivially simple to compare one 256-bit number to another. And randomness solves the problem of forgeability.\n\nNow, randomness (A.K.A. "entropy") is actually kind of hard to generate. Random numbers that don\'t have enough "noise" in them are known as "pseudo-random numbers", and are weirdly easy to guess. This is why Cloudflare uses a video stream of their [giant wall of lava lamps](https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/) to feed the random number generator that powers their CDN. For our purposes though, we can just imagine that our random numbers come from rolling a bunch of dice.\n\nTo recap, we can get a digital equivalent of a physical signature (or fingerprint, etc) by 1. coming up with a random number, and 2. feeding it into our chosen trapdoor function. The random number is called the "private" part. The output of the trapdoor function is called the "public" part. These two halves are often called "keys", hence the terms "public key" and "private key".\n\nAnd now we come full circle - remember about 37 years ago when I introduced the term "cryptographic identity"? Well, we\'ve finally arrived at the point where I explain what that actually is.\n\nA "cryptographic identity" is _identified_ by a public key, and _authenticated_ by the ability to prove that you know the private key.\n\nNotice that I didn\'t say "authenticated by the private key". If you had to reveal the private key in order to prove you know it, you could only authenticate a public key once without losing exclusive control of the key. But cryptographic identities can be authenticated any number of times because the certification is an _algorithm_ that only someone who knows the private key can execute.\n\nThis is the super power that trapdoor functions have that hash functions don\'t. Within certain cryptosystems, it is possible to mix additional data with your private key to get yet another number in such a way that someone else who only knows the public key can _prove_ that you know the private key.\n\nFor example, if my secret number is `12`, and someone tells me the number `37`, I can "combine" the two by adding them together and returning the number `49`. This "proves" that my secret number is `12`. Of course, addition is not a trapdoor function, so it\'s trivially easy to reverse, which is why cryptography is its own field of knowledge.\n\n# What\'s it for?\n\nIf I haven\'t completely lost you yet, you might be wondering why this matters. Who cares if I can prove that I made up a random number?\n\nTo answer this, let\'s consider a simple example: that of public social media posts.\n\nMost social media platforms function by issuing credentials and verifying them based on their internal database. When you log in to your Twitter (ok, fine, X) account, you provide X with a phone number (or email) and password. X compares these records to the ones stored in the database when you created your account, and if they match they let you "log in" by issuing yet another credential, called a "session key".\n\nNext, when you "say" something on X, you pass along your session key and your tweet to X\'s servers. They check that the session key is legit, and if it is they associate your tweet with your account\'s identity. Later, when someone wants to see the tweet, X vouches for the fact that you created it by saying "trust me" and displaying your name next to the tweet.\n\nIn other words, X creates and controls your identity, but they let you use it as long as you can prove that you know the secret that you agreed on when you registered (by giving it to them every time).\n\nNow pretend that X gets bought by someone _even more evil_ than Elon Musk (if such a thing can be imagined). The new owner now has the ability to control _your_ identity, potentially making it say things that you didn\'t actually say. Someone could be completely banned from the platform, but their account could be made to continue saying whatever the owner of the platform wanted.\n\nIn reality, such a breach of trust would quickly result in a complete loss of credibility for the platform, which is why this kind of thing doesn\'t happen (at least, not that we know of).\n\nBut there are other ways of exploiting this system, most notably by censoring speech. As often happens, platforms are able to confiscate user identities, leaving the tenant no recourse except to appeal to the platform itself (or the government, but that doesn\'t seem to happen for some reason - probably due to some legalese in social platforms\' terms of use). The user has to start completely from scratch, either on the same platform or another.\n\nNow suppose that when you signed up for X instead of simply telling X your password you made up a random number and provided a cryptographic proof to X along with your public key. When you\'re ready to tweet (there\'s no need to issue a session key, or even to store your public key in their database) you would again prove your ownership of that key with a new piece of data. X could then publish that tweet or not, along with the same proof you provided that it really came from you.\n\nWhat X _can\'t_ do in this system is pretend you said something you didn\'t, because they _don\'t know your private key_.\n\nX also wouldn\'t be able to deplatform you as effectively either. While they could choose to ban you from their website and refuse to serve your tweets, they don\'t control your identity. There\'s nothing they can do to prevent you from re-using it on another platform. Plus, if the system was set up in such a way that other users followed your key instead of an ID made up by X, you could switch platforms and _keep your followers_. In the same way, it would also be possible to keep a copy of all your tweets in your own database, since their authenticity is determined by _your_ digital signature, not X\'s "because I say so".\n\nThis new power is not just limited to social media either. Here are some other examples of ways that self-issued cryptographic identites transform the power dynamic inherent in digital platforms:\n\n- Banks sometimes freeze accounts or confiscate funds. If your money was stored in a system based on self-issued cryptographic keys rather than custodians, banks would not be able to keep you from accessing or moving your funds. This system exists, and it\'s called [bitcoin](https://bitcoin.rocks/).\n- Identity theft happens when your identifying information is stolen and used to take out a loan in your name, and without your consent. The reason this is so common is because your credentials are not cryptographic - your name, address, and social security number can only be authenticated by being shared, and they are shared so often and with so many counterparties that they frequently end up in data breaches. If credit checks were authenticated by self-issued cryptographic keys, identity theft would cease to exist (unless your private key itself got stolen).\n- Cryptographic keys allow credential issuers to protect their subjects\' privacy better too. Instead of showing your ID (including your home address, birth date, height, weight, etc), the DMV could sign a message asserting that the holder of a given public key indeed over 21. The liquor store could then validate that claim, and your ownership of the named key, without knowing anything more about you. [Zero-knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof) proofs take this a step further.\n\nIn each of these cases, the interests of the property owner, loan seeker, or customer are elevated over the interests of those who might seek to control their assets, exploit their hard work, or surveil their activity. Just as with personal privacy, freedom of speech, and Second Amendment rights the individual case is rarely decisive, but in the aggregate realigned incentives can tip the scale in favor of freedom.\n\n# Objections\n\nNow, there are some drawbacks to digital signatures. Systems that rely on digital signatures are frequently less forgiving of errors than their custodial counterparts, and many of their strengths have corresponding weaknesses. Part of this is because people haven\'t yet developed an intuition for how to use cryptographic identities, and the tools for managing them are still being designed. Other aspects can be mitigated through judicious use of keys fit to the problems they are being used to solve.\n\nBelow I\'ll articulate some of these concerns, and explore ways in which they might be mitigated over time.\n\n## Key Storage\n\nKeeping secrets is hard. "A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on", and the same goes for gossip. Key storage has become increasingly important as more of our lives move online, to the extent that password managers have become almost a requirement for keeping track of our digital lives. But even with good password management, credentials frequently end up for sale on the dark web as a consequence of poorly secured infrastructure.\n\nApart from the fact that all of this is an argument _for_ cryptographic identities (since keys are shared with far fewer parties), it\'s also true that the danger of losing a cryptographic key is severe, especially if that key is used in multiple places. Instead of hackers stealing your Facebook password, they might end up with access to all your other social media accounts too!\n\nKeys should be treated with the utmost care. Using password managers is a good start, but very valuable keys should be stored even more securely - for example in a [hardware signing device](https://nostrsigningdevice.com/). This is a hassle, and something additional to learn, but is an indispensable part of taking advantage of the benefits associated with cryptographic identity.\n\nThere are ways to lessen the impact of lost or stolen secrets, however. Lots of different techniques exist for structuring key systems in such a way that keys can be protected, invalidated, or limited. Here are a few:\n\n- [Hierarchical Deterministic Keys](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dijkhuis-cfrg-hdkeys-02.html) allow for the creation of a single root key from which multiple child keys can be generated. These keys are hard to link to the parent, which provides additional privacy, but this link can also be proven when necessary. One limitation is that the identity system has to be designed with HD keys in mind.\n- [Key Rotation](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41796/whats-the-purpose-of-key-rotation) allows keys to become expendable. Additional credentials might be attached to a key, allowing the holder to prove they have the right to rotate the key. Social attestations can help with the process as well if the key is embedded in a web of trust.\n- Remote Signing is a technique for storing a key on one device, but using it on another. This might take the form of signing using a hardware wallet and transferring an SD card to your computer for broadcasting, or using a mobile app like [Amber](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Amber) to manage sessions with different applications.\n- [Key](https://github.com/coracle-social/promenade/tree/master) [sharding](https://www.frostr.org/) takes this to another level by breaking a single key into multiple pieces and storing them separately. A coordinator can then be used to collaboratively sign messages without sharing key material. This dramatically reduces the ability of an attacker to steal a complete key.\n\n## Multi-Factor Authentication\n\nOne method for helping users secure their accounts that is becoming increasingly common is "multi-factor authentication". Instead of just providing your email and password, platforms send a one-time use code to your phone number or email, or use "time-based one time passwords" which are stored in a password manager or on a hardware device.\n\nAgain, MFA is a solution to a problem inherent in account-based authentication which would not be nearly so prevalent in a cryptographic identity system. Still, theft of keys does happen, and so MFA would be an important improvement - if not for an extra layer of authentication, then as a basis for key rotation.\n\nIn a sense, MFA is already being researched - key shards is one way of creating multiple credentials from a single key. However, this doesn\'t address the issue of key rotation, especially when an identity is tied to the public key that corresponds to a given private key. There are two possible solutions to this problem:\n\n- Introduce a naming system. This would allow identities to use a durable name, assigning it to different keys over time. The downside is that this would require the introduction of either centralized naming authorities (back to the old model), or a blockchain in order to solve [Zooko\'s trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle).\n- Establish a chain of keys. This would require a given key to name a successor key in advance and self-invalidate, or some other process like social recovery to invalidate an old key and assign the identity to a new one. This also would significantly increase the complexity of validating messages and associating them with a given identity.\n\nBoth solutions are workable, but introduce a lot of complexity that could cause more trouble than it\'s worth, depending on the identity system we\'re talking about.\n\n## Surveillance\n\nOne of the nice qualities that systems based on cryptographic identities have is that digitally signed data can be passed through any number of untrusted systems and emerge intact. This ability to resist tampering makes it possible to broadcast signed data more widely than would otherwise be the case in a system that relies on a custodian to authenticate information.\n\nThe downside of this is that more untrusted systems have access to data. And if information is broadcast publicly, anyone can get access to it.\n\nThis problem is compounded by re-use of cryptographic identities across multiple contexts. A benefit of self-issued credentials is that it becomes possible to bring everything attached to your identity with you, including social context and attached credentials. This is convenient and can be quite powerful, but it also means that more context is attached to your activity, making it easier to infer information about you for advertising or surveillance purposes. This is dangerously close to the dystopian ideal of a "Digital ID".\n\nThe best way to deal with this risk is to consider identity re-use an option to be used when desirable, but to default to creating a new key for every identity you create. This is no worse than the status quo, and it makes room for the ability to link identities when desired.\n\nAnother possible approach to this problem is to avoid broadcasting signed data when possible. This could be done by obscuring your cryptographic identity when data is served from a database, or by encrypting your signed data in order to selectively share it with named counterparties.\n\nStill, this is a real risk, and should be kept in mind when designing and using systems based on cryptographic identity. If you\'d like to read more about this, please see [this blog post](https://habla.news/u/hodlbod@coracle.social/1687802006398).\n\n# Making Keys Usable\n\nYou might be tempted to look at that list of trade-offs and get the sense that cryptographic identity is not for mere mortals. Key management is hard, and footguns abound - but there is a way forward. With [nostr](https://nostr.com/), some new things are happening in the world of key management that have never really happened before.\n\nPlenty of work over the last 30 years has gone into making key management tractable, but none have really been widely adopted. The reason for this is simple: network effect.\n\nMany of these older key systems only applied the thinnest veneer of humanity over keys. But an identity is much richer than a mere label. Having a real name, social connections, and a corpus of work to attach to a key creates a system of keys that _humans care about_.\n\nBy bootstrapping key management within a social context, nostr ensures that the payoff of key management is worth the learning curve. Not only is social engagement a strong incentive to get off the ground, people already on the network are eager to help you get past any roadblocks you might face.\n\nSo if I could offer an action item: give nostr a try today. Whether you\'re in it for the people and their values, or you just want to experiment with cryptographic identity, nostr is a great place to start.

I hope it\'s been helpful, and I can\'t wait to see you on nostr!\n\n',

      'A couple of weeks ago, I shared a post on Nostr about my curiosity surrounding the carnivore diet. As someone who spent over 20 years as a vegetarian‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding five strict vegan years‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs been a wild shift. I‚Äôd been reading a lot about the diet‚Äôs potential benefits, especially for reducing fatigue and inflammation, and wondered if it could help me as a runner and a woman constantly battling low energy.\n\nWhat I didn‚Äôt expect was how fascinating, hilarious, and downright strange this journey would be, especially as someone who grew up in Berlin, where meat-eaters are often seen as the enemy. Let me walk you through my experience, from meat aversion to savoring steak, and everything in between.\n\n## Why I became vegetarian\n\nTo understand my shift, you need to know where I came from. I grew up in Berlin in a household that valued high-quality food, including meat. My parents ate meat, but only the good stuff‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälocal, organic, free from antibiotics. Still, I just *didn‚Äôt* like the taste of it. Even as a kid, I avoided meat whenever I could, and since most of my friends were vegetarian too, it felt completely normal.\n\nWhen I moved to London in 2015, I took things further and went fully vegan. *Why?* Well, two reasons:\n\n1. **Ethics & costs**: seeing a whole chicken priced at ¬£3 made me question the source and quality of animal products in general. Eggs, dairy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhere was this stuff even coming from?\n2. **Health beliefs**: I was convinced I was lactose intolerant, so cutting dairy seemed like a no-brainer.\n\nBack then, I was broke and couldn\'t afford organic groceries, so I stuck to a clean, whole-food, plant-based diet. No fake cheese or vegan "meat" substitutes‚Ää-‚Ääjust veggies, grains, and nuts. It wasn\'t bad, but in hindsight, I realize I was often bloated and never truly satiated.\n\nBack then, I was broke and couldn‚Äôt afford organic groceries, so I stuck to a clean, whole-food, plant-based diet. No fake cheese or vegan ‚Äúmeat‚Äù substitutes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust veggies, grains, and nuts. It wasn‚Äôt bad, but in hindsight, I realize I was often bloated and never truly satiated.\n\n## Returning to eggs and¬†fish\n\nAfter a couple of years, I moved back to Berlin and started reintroducing eggs and fish into my diet. The change was *immediate*. I felt more awake and energized, and I began to notice how different foods made me feel. It wasn‚Äôt just about ideology anymore‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was about what my body needed.\n\nAround this time, a friend stayed at my flat and threw out all the ‚Äújunk‚Äù in my kitchen: seed oils, processed foods, and anything overly refined. In their place, they stocked my shelves with high-quality, nutrient-dense options. It was a turning point, but it still took me another year to reintroduce dairy. Cheese came first, but I avoided milk and yogurt for a long time, clinging to plant-based alternatives (minus soy‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôd given up on that).\n\n## The Berlin¬†steak\n\n\nThe real game-changer came this past September, a few weeks before I flew to Argentina. After years of avoiding meat, I decided to take the leap in Berlin, with the only three people I know who love meat that time.&nbsp;\nI can still picture the scene. It was a cozy restaurant with friends who were as curious as I was about how this experiment would go. When the steak arrived, I was nervous‚Ää-‚Ääexcited but hesitant. Cutting into it, I couldn\'t help but wonder, "Is this going to mess me up? Will I even like it?"\nTo my surprise, it was good. Really good. And for the first time in years, I felt full. Not bloated, not "I guess I ate something" full‚Ää-‚Ääbut deeply, truly satisfied. That moment shattered so many of my mental barriers around meat. I didn\'t feel guilty, and more importantly, my body didn\'t rebel. It felt fine. It felt great, even.\nThat steak opened the door. A couple of weeks later, I boarded a plane to South America, ready to take this experiment to the next level.\n\n## The South American meat adventure\n\nLanding in Argentina‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe global capital of steak‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI knew this was the perfect place to dive deeper into my carnivore journey. Here, meat isn‚Äôt just food; it‚Äôs culture, art, and community. Surrounded by people who were thrilled to guide me, I started trying different cuts, exploring flavors, and, for the first time, cooking meat for myself.\n\nWhat surprised me most was the quality. The meat here isn‚Äôt just any meat‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs grass-fed, tender, and bursting with flavor. Every cut offered something new, and I began to see steak as more than ‚Äújust meat.‚Äù It became a source of nourishment and enjoyment in a way I never thought possible.\n\nAt the same time, other small shifts began happening. I stopped drinking almond milk after realizing it was packed with seed oils, switching back to real milk. I traded plant-based yogurt for the real thing. Each step felt natural, and my body responded with more energy and clarity.\n\n## The struggles\n\nNot everything has been smooth sailing, though. One night, we went to a restaurant offering endless meat, including more adventurous options like chicken hearts. My friends encouraged me to try, but my brain wasn‚Äôt having it. Even wrapped in lettuce to disguise the texture, I couldn‚Äôt get past the mental block. Baby steps, right?\n\nTwo months into eating meat, I feel stronger than ever. I‚Äôm not constantly hungry, and for the first time, I‚Äôve experienced what it feels like to be truly full after a meal. It‚Äôs a complete 180 from my vegan days, where I often felt bloated yet unsatisfied.\n\nThis journey has been as much about unlearning old beliefs as it has been about embracing new habits. While I‚Äôm still working on organ meats (maybe one day!), I‚Äôm excited to see where this path takes me.\n\nTo anyone considering a similar shift, I‚Äôll say this: Listen to your body, take it one step at a time, and don‚Äôt be afraid to challenge your assumptions. My journey isn‚Äôt about proving one diet is better than another‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs about finding what works for *me*.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a meat-lover or a lifelong vegetarian, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever tried a radical dietary change? What did you learn?Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämeat or no meat!\n\n#### ',

      "**Food is Everything.** It shapes how you look, how you feel, how you think, and ultimately ‚Äî how you live. Every system in your body runs on what you put into it. But most of what we‚Äôre told is ‚Äúfood‚Äù today isn‚Äôt actually food at all.\n\nWe‚Äôre living in a world of *fiat food* ‚Äî ultra-processed, nutrient-depleted products designed to look cheap while hiding the true cost of inflation. Real, nourishing food like grass-fed steak from your local butcher is priced like a luxury, while fake food pumped full of seed oils and fillers is made artificially cheap. They‚Äôve quietly stripped the nutrients out of our food to protect the illusion that everything‚Äôs ‚Äúaffordable.‚Äù\n\nI didn‚Äôt understand any of this when I left home for college. I thought I was eating well. I thought I was making smart choices. I was doing everything ‚Äúright‚Äù, at least according to the mainstream. What I didn‚Äôt realize was that I was slowly destroying my body.\n\nThis is my story of waking up to the truth about food ‚Äî and taking my health back.\n\nWhen I moved out for college, I was on my own for meals for the first time. As a college athlete, I knew fuelling my body mattered, but little did I know, I had no idea how to actually do it. I was 18, heavily influenced by what I saw online and what my friends were doing. The internet screamed one thing: hit your protein goals, keep your calories low. So that‚Äôs what I did.\n\nMy diet turned into a rotation of protein shakes and bars with ingredient lists I couldn‚Äôt even pronounce. Outside of that, I relied on packaged meals from the grocery store, the kind labeled ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù They looked clean on the outside, but were filled with preservatives, seed oils, and artificial additives. As long as the label said ‚Äúhigh protein,‚Äù it felt like I was doing the right thing. But I wasn‚Äôt. My body knew it before I did.\n\nAfter a few months, I became severely constipated. I would go an entire week without a bowel movement, over and over again. The pain was constant and consuming. I felt bloated everyday, like there was a brick sitting in my stomach. I tried adding fiber to my diet, drinking more water, taking laxatives, but nothing worked. My stomach was distended, my energy was gone, and I started to feel like my body was turning against me. But still, I didn't make the connection. I was \"eating healthy\" right? High protein, low calorie. I couldn't see that my gut was shutting down, because I thought I was doing everything right.\n\nEventually, the internal issues started showing up on the outside, and nowhere was more obvious than my face. My acne became the worst it had ever been, painful and inflamed. I tried everything the internet recommended: new face washes, topical treatments, and expensive skincare. I was ashamed of how I looked. I wore makeup everyday to hide the redness and texture, desperate to feel normal. But, none of it worked because the problem was not skin deep. My skin was a reflection of the damage happening inside my body, and I just did not know it yet.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdxTGXYtObhRzkQqNaQhA_o8VNk3FLmOw9M1A8uUYsfGePtf4pOutMFDzgUBSyoDx1CPeClqvrzvx0a-JxTH4fWE8AyFXn9BrpIwBRqT_8hSrvBIzZzlTUHUUuhRV-J0d4JV7bJWw?key=2MCX7m1_WrWzer6-EplTYA)\n\nThe truth is, we're being fed poison that wrecks not just our gut, hormones, and metabolism, but our skin, our confidence, and our mental health. Instead of being offered real solutions, we're told to fix these problems with even more poison: harsh topicals, and pharmaceuticals. When these skincare products don't work, the next step is Accutane. Accutane is a drug so strong it can cause birth defects and liver damage. I have friends on it. I see what it does. It's all part of the same system: create the problem, then sell the \"cure\". The system is broken, and the only way out is to stop playing by its rules.\n\nAround the same time, the skin on my body began to change. I developed dark patches on my stomach and back, almost like leopard spots. This was very concerning to me as a young girl and beach volleyball athlete. I would look at myself in the mirror and cry. I went to the doctor, but she brushed it off without offering any answers (thanks, Canadian healthcare). She barely looked at my skin before prescribing me with medication to cure skin fungus. I used this medication for a year. My skin only got worse.\n\n![](https://blossom.primal.net/63295138eda7c78c03aa5b394702e9134b1644d0411690ebfa32b8eaead4377c.jpg)\n\nI was tired of cycling through medications for skin fungus (that no doctor confirmed I actually had) and seeing no results, so I finally pushed for a biopsy. The diagnosis: EDP - a chronic, incurable skin condition. My doctor told me nothing caused it, and nothing could cure it. It was just something I would have to live with. But I couldn't accept that. I spoke with my (based) parents and they pushed me to make a radical shift in my diet. I cut out dairy, seed oils, and gluten completely. I want to clarify - **high quality dairy is not inherently bad&#x20;**- but in my research, I found that there could be a link between EDP and dairy, so I removed it to see how my body would respond. I focused on real, nutrient-dense foods: high-quality eggs and grass-fed steak everyday. I eliminated all industrial cooking oils from my kitchen and started cooking exclusively with grass-fed butter and beef tallow.\n\nThat changed everything.\n\nThe ‚Äúincurable‚Äù skin spots disappeared completely. What started as a desperate attempt to heal my skin turned into a full body transformation. My acne cleared. I lost 10 pounds without even trying. I was finally having regular bowel movements. I had energy again. Mental clarity. Confidence. For the first time in years, I felt like *myself.*\n\nThat's when I started waking up to the bigger picture. It wasn't just about food anymore, it was about the system. The healthcare system that offered me pills instead of solutions. The nutrition classes that pushed food pyramids built by corporate lobbyists. The \"experts\" who told me nothing was wrong, when everything clearly was. It all clicked: the system isn't broken, it's functioning exactly as designed. And it's not designed to make you healthy.\n\nMy experience with fiat food, and all the horrible side effects that came with it, taught me one of the most important lessons of my life: **question everything.&#x20;**&#x49;t forced me to stop blindly trusting the system. If I hadn't gone through all of it - the gut issues, the acne, the diagnosis, the healing - I genuinely don't think I would see the world in the way I do now.\n\nIt opened my eyes to the way governments operate, how the health industry profits off sickness, and how deeply broken the food system really is. But more than that, it helped me understand why Bitcoin and Nostr matter. Why decentralization matters. Why sovereignty matters.\n\nEveryone has their own story. Their own moment when they realize society, the economy, and health are not what they seem. For some, it's money. For others, it's politics. For me, food was the crack in the illusion. And I'm grateful for that. Because once you see it, you can't unsee it, and from there you can finally start taking your power back.\n\nIn the end, **all of these problems are symptoms of broken money**. When money is manipulated, everything built on top of it becomes distorted. From our food supply to our healthcare to our freedom. That's why **fixing the money fixes the system.&#x20;**&#x42;itcoin is a lifeline. It's how we reclaim truth, health, and sovereignty.\n",

      '\n# Nostr: a quick introduction, attempt #1\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*TyaSRBLhkTNgEoIJ)\n\nNostr doesn\'t have a material existence, it is not a website or an app. Nostr is just a description what kind of messages each computer can send to the others and vice-versa. It\'s a very simple thing, but the fact that such description exists allows different apps to connect to different servers automatically, without people having to talk behind the scenes or sign contracts or anything like that.\n\nWhen you use a Nostr _client_ that is what happens, your _client_ will connect to a bunch of servers, called _relays_, and all these _relays_ will speak the same "language" so your _client_ will be able to publish notes to them all and also download notes from other people.\n\nThat\'s basically what Nostr is: this communication layer between the _client_ you run on your phone or desktop computer and the _relay_ that someone else is running on some server somewhere. There is no central authority dictating who can connect to whom or even anyone who knows for sure where each note is stored.\n\nIf you think about it, Nostr is very much like the internet itself: there are millions of websites out there, and basically anyone can run a new one, and there are websites that allow you to store and publish your stuff on them.\n\nThe added benefit of Nostr is that this unified "language" that all Nostr _clients_ speak allow them to switch very easily and cleanly between _relays_. So if one _relay_ decides to ban someone that person can switch to publishing to others _relays_ and their audience will quickly follow them there. Likewise, it becomes much easier for _relays_ to impose any restrictions they want on their users: no _relay_ has to uphold a moral ground of "absolute free speech": each _relay_ can decide to delete notes or ban users for no reason, or even only store notes from a preselected set of people and no one will be entitled to complain about that.\n\nThere are some bad things about this design: on Nostr there are no guarantees that _relays_ will have the notes you want to read or that they will store the notes you\'re sending to them. We can\'t just assume all _relays_ will have everything ‚Äî much to the contrary, as Nostr grows more _relays_ will exist and people will tend to publishing to a small set of all the _relays_, so depending on the decisions each _client_ takes when publishing and when fetching notes, users may see a different set of replies to a note, for example, and be confused.\n\nAnother problem with the idea of publishing to multiple servers is that they may be run by all sorts of malicious people that may edit your notes. Since no one wants to see garbage published under their name, Nostr fixes that by requiring notes to have a cryptographic signature. This signature is attached to the note and verified by everybody at all times, which ensures the notes weren\'t tampered (if any part of the note is changed even by a single character that would cause the signature to become invalid and then the note would be dropped). The fix is perfect, except for the fact that it introduces the requirement that each user must now hold this 63-character code that starts with "nsec1", which they must not reveal to anyone. Although annoying, this requirement brings another benefit: that users can automatically have the same identity in many different contexts and even use their Nostr identity to login to non-Nostr websites easily without having to rely on any third-party.\n\nTo conclude: Nostr is like the internet (or the internet of some decades ago): a little chaotic, but very open. It is better than the internet because it is structured and actions can be automated, but, like in the internet itself, nothing is guaranteed to work at all times and users many have to do some manual work from time to time to fix things. Plus, there is the cryptographic key stuff, which is painful, but cool.\n',

It leaves no room for error because security has the highest priority in those circles.\n\nBut on nostr the Web of Trust is a side effect of just following people. You press Follow a few times and you are accidentally building a Web of Trust without even knowing it. It might not be perfect, but that‚Äôs also why it works, because it is so simple, like nostr itself.\n\nAttempts to ‚Äúfix‚Äù or improve the Web of Trust should be made with that simplicity in mind. Creating new lists with granularity of people you really trust, partially trust, don‚Äôt trust at all etc are all great, but this will make it possible for it to end up like PGP. Nostr‚Äôs Web of Trust works precisely because people don‚Äôt have to think about it.\n\nThere is also this idea that likes, reposts or any signal that can be made by users are useless because they can be gamed, but they can only be gamed if you don‚Äôt use a Web of Trust.\n\n**Web of Trust fixes almost everything**\n\nnostr:note1a8nq7kdqgr20dnvzmhv2a6quy8vx3l56pfzjlly3jv2u2l55exhs84cev8\n\nWeb of Trust fixes spam, bots, abuse of trending/hot algorithms \n\nZaps were supposed to fix the problem of gaming/abusing likes or reposts, but Web of Trust fixes it better. Zaps are useful for sending value, so let‚Äôs use it to send actual value. 1 sat zaps are not much different from Like-spam and considering the technical overhead required for zaps and possibility for timeouts and failures it‚Äôs actually worse.\n\nSo, Web of Trust Makes Likes Great Again, and with that you can make algorithms that are useful to the individual instead of the advertisers or platforms.\n\n![image](https://nostur.com/a/nostur-wot.png)\n*Example of a most basic Web of Trust filter (follows + follows of follows)*\n\nNostur uses follows + follows of follows to filter spam and bots, and it uses likes and reposts from follows uniquely ranked to create Hot and Gallery feeds.\n\nAnother example is nostr:npub1yxprsscnjw2e6myxz73mmzvnqw5kvzd5ffjya9ecjypc5l0gvgksh8qud4‚Äòs https://oddbean.com, a community website where the content of the community is based on the administrator‚Äôs follows, the algorithm is incredibly simple and transparent, and it wouldn‚Äôt be possible if nostr did not have an accidental Web of Trust:\n![image](https://nostur.com/a/oddbean-wot.png)\n\n**Challenges**\n\nNow there are still some challenges to be solved, new users being onboarded won‚Äôt have a Web of Trust yet, maybe we could give them training wheels, a preloaded Web of Trust until they followed enough people to use their own. \n\nAlso, new users don‚Äôt exist in anyone else‚Äôs Web of Trust yet, so they won‚Äôt be seen until someone follows them. This is not a good new user experience.\n\nYou also might miss someone‚Äôs post because they are not in your Web of Trust yet.\n\nThese are all challenges and I will keep exploring solutions for these.\n",

      "# The importance of being lindy\n\nI've been thinking about what Vitor said about #Amethyst living on extended time. And thinking. And doing a bit more thinking...\n\n![Winnie the Pooh](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/89/b1/c0/89b1c00006954836a703dfc0457c8626.jpg)\n\nIt's a valid point. Why does Amethyst (or, analog, #Damus) still exist? Why is it as popular as it is? Shouldn't they be quickly washed-away by power-funded corporate offerings or highly-polished, **blackbox-coded apps**?\n\nBecause a lot of people trust them to read the code, that's why. The same way that they trust Michael to read it and they trust me to test it. And, perhaps more importantly, they trust us to not deliver corrupted code. Intentionally, or inadvertently.\n\n> The developer's main job will not be coding the commit, it will be reviewing and approving the PR.\n\nAs AI -- which all developers now use, to some extent, if they are planning on remaining in the business -- becomes more efficient and effective at writing the code, the effort shifts to evaluating and curating what it writes. That makes software code a commodity, and commodities are rated according to brand.\n\nMost of us don't want to make our own shampoo, for instance. Rather, we go to the store and select the brand that we're used to. We have learned, over the years, that this brand won't kill us and does the job we expect it to do. Offloading the decision of *Which shampoo?* to a brand is worth some of our time and money, which is why strong, reliable brands can charge a premium and are difficult to dislodge.\n\nEven people, like myself, who can read the code from many common programming languages, do not have the time, energy, or interest to read through thousands of lines of Kotlin, Golang, or Typescript or -- God forbid -- C++, from repos we are not actively working on. And asking AI to analyze the code for you leaves you trusting the AI to have a conscience and be virtuous, and may you have fun with that.\n\nThe software is no longer the brand. The feature set alone isn't enough. And the manner in which it is written, or the tools it was written with, are largely irrelevant. The thing that matters most is *Who approved this version?*\n\n# The Era of Software Judges has arrived\n\n![Judge Taylor](https://thecriticalcritics.com/review/wp-content/images/judge-taylor-movie-judges.jpg)\n\nAnd that has always been the thing that mattered most, really. \n\nThat's why software inertia is a real thing and that's why it's going to still be worth it to train up junior devs. Those devs will be trained up to be *moral actors*, specializing in reviewing and testing code and confirming its adherance to the project's ethical standards. Because those standards aren't universal; they're nuanced and edge cases will need to be carefully weighed and judged and evaluated and analysed. It will not be enough to add *Don't be evil.* to the command prompt and call it a day.\n\nSo, we shall need judges and advocates, and we must train them up, in the way they shall go.",

      "Vibe coding is taking the nostr developer community by storm. While it's all very exciting and interesting, I think it's important to pump the brakes a little - not in order to stop the vehicle, but to try to keep us from flying off the road as we approach this curve.\n\nIn this note Pablo is subtweeting something I said to him recently (although I'm sure he's heard it from other quarters as well):\n\nnostr:nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzp75cf0tahv5z7plpdeaws7ex52nmnwgtwfr2g3m37r844evqrr6jqy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyv9kh2uewd9hj7qghwaehxw309aex2mrp0yh8qunfd4skctnwv46z7qg6waehxw309ac8junpd45kgtnxd9shg6npvchxxmmd9uqzq0z48d4ttzzkupswnkyt5a2xfkhxl3hyavnxjujwn5k2k529aearwtecp4\n\nThere is a naive, curmudgeonly case for simply \"not doing AI\". I think the intuition is a good one, but the subject is obviously more complicated - not doing it, either on an individual or a collective level, is just not an option. I recently read Tools for Conviviality by Ivan Illich, which I think can help us here. For Illich, the best kind of tool is one which serves \"politically interrelated individuals rather than managers\".\n\nThis is obviously a core value for bitcoiners. And I think the talks given at the Oslo Freedom Forum this year present a compelling case for adoption of LLMs for the purposes of 1. using them for good, and 2. developing them further so that they don't get captured by corporations and governments. Illich calls both the telephone and print \"almost ideally convivial\". I would add the internet, cryptography, and LLMs to this list, because each one allows individuals to work cooperatively within communities to embody their values in their work.\n\nBut this is only half the story. Illich also points out how \"the manipulative nature of institutions... have put these ideally convivial tools at the service of more [managerial dominance].\"\n\nPreventing the subversion and capture of our tools is not just a matter of who uses what, and for which ends. It also requires an awareness of the environment that the use of the tool (whether for virtuous or vicious ends) creates, which in turn forms the abilities, values, and desires of those who inhabit the environment.\n\nThe natural tendency of LLMs is to foster ignorance, dependence, and detachment from reality. This is not the fault of the tool itself, but that of humans' tendency to trade liberty for convenience. Nevertheless, the inherent values of a given tool naturally gives rise to an environment through use: the tool changes the world that the tool user lives in. This in turn indoctrinates the user into the internal logic of the tool, shaping their thinking, blinding them to the tool's influence, and neutering their ability to work in ways not endorsed by the structure of the tool-defined environment.\n\nThe result of this is that people are _formed_ by their tools, becoming their slaves. We often talk about LLM misalignment, but the same is true of humans. Unreflective use of a tool creates people who are misaligned with their own interests. This is what I mean when I say that AI use is anti-human. I mean it in the same way that all unreflective tool use is anti-human. See Wendell Berry for an evaluation of industrial agriculture along the same lines.\n\nWhat I'm not claiming is that a minority of high agency individuals can't use the technology for virtuous ends. In fact, I think that is an essential part of the solution. Tool use can be good. But tools that bring their users into dependence on complex industry and catechize their users into a particular system should be approached with extra caution. The plow was a convivial tool, and so were early tractors. Self-driving John Deere monstrosities are a straightforward extension of the earlier form of the technology, but are self-evidently an instrument of debt slavery, chemical dependency, industrial centralization, and degradation of the land. This over-extension of a given tool can occur regardless of the intentions of the user. As Illich says:\n\n> There is a form of malfunction in which growth does not yet tend toward the destruction of life, yet renders a tool antagonistic to its specific aims. Tools, in other words, have an optimal, a tolerable, and a negative range.\n\nThe initial form of a tool is almost always beneficial, because tools are made by humans for human ends. But as the scale of the tool grows, its logic gets more widely and forcibly applied. The solution to the anti-human tendencies of any technology is an understanding of scale. To prevent the overrun of the internal logic of a given tool and its creation of an environment hostile to human flourishing, we need to impose limits on scale.\n\n> Tools that require time periods or spaces or energies much beyond the order of corresponding natural scales are dysfunctional.\n\nMy problem with LLMs is:\n\n- Not their imitation of human idioms, but their subversion of them and the resulting adoption of robotic idioms by humans\n- Not the access they grant to information, but their ability to obscure accurate or relevant information\n- Not their elimination of menial work, but its increase (Bullshit Jobs)\n- Not their ability to take away jobs, but their ability to take away the meaning found in good work\n- Not their ability to confer power to the user, but their ability to confer power to their owner which can be used to exploit the user\n- Not their ability to solve problems mechanistically, but the extension of their mechanistic value system to human life\n- Not their explicit promise of productivity, but the environment they implicitly create in which productivity depends on their use\n- Not the conversations they are able to participate in, but the relationships they displace\n\nAll of these dysfunctions come from the over-application of the technology in evaluating and executing the fundamentally human task of _living_. AI work is the same kind of thing as an AI girlfriend, because work is not only for the creation of value (although that's an essential part of it), but also for the exercise of human agency in the world. In other words, tools must be tools, not masters. This is a problem of scale - when tool use is extended beyond its appropriate domain, it becomes what Illich calls a \"radical monopoly\" (the domination of a single paradigm over all of human life).\n\nSo the important question when dealing with any emergent technology becomes: how can we set limits such that the use of the technology is naturally confined to its appropriate scale?\n\nHere are some considerations:\n\n- Teach people how to use the technology well (e.g. cite sources when doing research, use context files instead of fighting the prompt, know when to ask questions rather than generate code)\n- Create and use open source and self-hosted models and tools (MCP, stacks, tenex). Refuse to pay for closed or third-party hosted models and tools.\n- Recognize the dependencies of the tool itself, for example GPU availability, and diversify the industrial sources to reduce fragility and dependence.\n- Create models with built-in limits. The big companies have attempted this (resulting in Japanese Vikings), but the best-case effect is a top-down imposition of corporate values onto individuals. But the idea isn't inherently bad - a coding model that refuses to generate code in response to vague prompts, or which asks clarifying questions is an example. Or a home assistant that recognized childrens' voices and refuses to interact.\n- Divert the productivity gains to human enrichment. Without mundane work to do, novice lawyers, coders, and accountants don't have an opportunity to hone their skills. But their learning could be subsidized by the bots in order to bring them up to a level that continues to be useful.\n- Don't become a slave to the bots. Know when not to use it. Talk to real people. Write real code, poetry, novels, scripts. Do your own research. Learn by experience. Make your own stuff. Take a break from reviewing code to write some. Be independent, impossible to control. Don't underestimate the value to your soul of good work.\n- Resist both monopoly and \"radical monopoly\". Both naturally collapse over time, but by cultivating an appreciation of the goodness of hand-crafted goods, non-synthetic entertainment, embodied relationship, and a balance between mobility and place, we can relegate new, threatening technologies to their correct role in society.\n\nI think in all of this is implicit the idea of technological determinism, that productivity is power, and if you don't adapt you die. I reject this as an artifact of darwinism and materialism. The world is far more complex and full of grace than we think.\n\nThe idea that productivity creates wealth is, as we all know, bunk. GDP continues to go up, but ungrounded metrics don't reflect anything about the reality of human flourishing. We have to return to a qualitative understanding of life as whole, and contextualize quantitative tools and metrics within that framework.\n\nFinally, don't believe the hype. Even if AI delivers everything it promises, conservatism in changing our ways of life will decelerate the rate of change society is subjected to and allow time for reflection and proper use of the tool. Curmudgeons are as valuable as technologists. There will be no jobspocalypse if there is sufficient political will to value human good over mere productivity. It's ok to pump the breaks.\n",

      "I just read this, and found it enlightening.\n\n> Jung... notes that intelligence can be seen as problem solving at an everyday level..., whereas creativity may represent problem solving for less common issues\n\n> Other studies have used metaphor creation as a creativity measure instead of divergent thinking and a spectrum of CHC components instead of just g and have found much higher relationships between creativity and intelligence than past studies\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/3/3/59\n\nI'm unusually intelligent (Who isn't?), but I'm much more creative, than intelligent, and I think that confuses people. The ability to apply intelligence, to solve completely novel problems, on the fly, is something IQ tests don't even claim to measure. They just claim a correlation.\n\nCreativity requires taking wild, mental leaps out into nothingness; simply trusting that your brain will land you safely.\nAnd this is why I've been at the forefront of massive innovation, over and over, but never got rich off of it.\n\n*I'm a starving autist.*\n\nZaps are the first time I've ever made money directly, for solving novel problems. Companies don't do this because there is a span of time between providing a solution and the solution being implemented, and the person building the implementation (or their boss) receives all the credit for the existence of the solution. At best, you can hope to get pawned off with a small bonus.\n\nNobody can remember who came up with the solution, originally, and that person might not even be there, anymore, and probably never filed a patent, and may have no idea that their idea has even been built. They just run across it, later, in a tech magazine or museum, and say, \"Well, will you look at that! Someone actually went and built it! Isn't that nice!\"\n\nUniversities at least had the idea of cementing novel solutions in academic papers, but that:\n1) only works if you're an academic, and at a university,\n2) is an incredibly slow process, not appropriate for a truly innovative field,\n3) leads to manifestations of perverse incentives and biased research frameworks, coming from 'publish or perish' policies.\n\nBut I think long-form notes and zaps solve for this problem. #Alexandria, especially, is being built to cater to this long-suffering class of chronic underachievers. It leaves a written, public, time-stamped record of *Clever Ideas We Have Had*.\n\nBecause they are clever, the ideas.\nAnd we have had them.",
